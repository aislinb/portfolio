          I am a linguist and analyst who is now pursuing a career in software engineering. I&apos;ve worked in tech-adjacent roles within sales and business operations, from start-ups to international corporations. This experience has honed my organisational skills and attention to detail, whilst instilling in me a curiosity to understand and learn such technologies myself. I am now looking for a dynamic working environment in which learning is at the core of its values.
